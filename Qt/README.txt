Aldranor!

A meadow with a stream and some islands and some floaty globes.

TODO:
•	Water: I’m going to port last semester’s project to openGL 4 and probably use it relatively unchanged, but since I’ll be writing my own transformation matrices I’ll get depth mapping working.
•	Terrain: Generated by a height map with a normal map applied if I can make one, I’ll just use a detailed height map if I can’t.
•	Grass: Generated by tessellation and geometry shaders.
•	Boulders and crags: These should be fun. I can’t find examples of people using noise to programmatically generate boulders, so I’m going to figure it out. My first thought is to modify the vertices in the vertex shader or a tessellation shader using some sort of programmatically generated texture. I expect the stone in the scene to take the most time, there will be randomly scattered boulders and craggy cliffs on the mountains. I’ll start by making textures in Photoshop to test, then move on to generating them so they’re random if I can.
•	Glowing flowers/mushrooms/floating blue orbs if I run out of time: These will illuminate the scene and have bloom applied so they appear to glow, as soon as I get the freakin’ bloom working! (As of 2:15 a.m. two weeks after that homework was due I can render one of the textures I need to create bloom but not both.)
•	Moss textures fading to sand textures to ease the transition between grassy land and sandy streambed
•	Skybox: trivial, last semester’s will work.

Known bugs:
- The lighting isn't right, look at the cube upside down and watch the light on the faces.
